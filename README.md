# TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe C++ Project to be played in console.

When the program is running, type 'c' if you would like to play against the computer. Typinging any other letter than pressing enter will make it a Human vs. Human game.

Use the coordinate system labelled across the board to input moves (A/B/C, 1/2/3) Example "A1".

The first player will be X and the other will be O

Once the player has inputted a valid move, it becomes the other player's turn

First player to get 3 in a row wins!
