# TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe C++ Project to be played in console.

For now. one must modify the code to decide whether they will like to play Human versus Human or Human versus Computer.
(change "human" to "false" in Player 2 initialization)

Run the program and use coordinate system labelled across the board to input moves (A/B/C, 1/2/3)

The first player will be X and the other will be O

Once the player has inputted a valid move, it becomes the other player's turn

First player to get 3 in a row wins!
